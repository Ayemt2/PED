# PED
# 🛠️ Custom PCB Design Project

This repository contains the design files for a **Printed Circuit Board (PCB)** project created as part of my coursework and self-learning in **Electronic Circuit Design** and **Embedded Systems**. The project was developed using **Altium Designer**, and includes schematic design, PCB layout, and component placement.
